You will understand the syntax of INSERT statements, how to insert data into specific columns, how to insert multiple records with a single INSERT statement, and handling constraints such as primary key and foreign key constraints.","explanation":"SQL Insertion Course teaches you how to add new records to a database using SQL INSERT statements. For example, you might insert a new student\'s information into a \'Students\' table, specifying their name, age, and grade. You\'ll understand the syntax of INSERT statements and learn to handle constraints like primary and foreign keys. This is fundamental for managing databases and keeping data up-to-date.","stage":1},{"uid":4,"title":"SQL Deletion Course","description":"In this course, you will explore SQL DELETE statement, which is used to remove records from a database table. You will understand the syntax of DELETE statements, using WHERE clause to specify which records to delete, handling scenarios such as deleting all records or using subqueries for complex deletion operations. Additionally, you will learn about the implications of cascading deletes and how to use them effectively.","explanation":"SQL Deletion Course delves into the SQL DELETE statement for removing records from a database table. For instance, you might delete inactive user accounts from a \'Users\' table based on a certain condition using the WHERE clause. You\'ll learn the syntax of DELETE statements, using WHERE clause for specific deletions, and handling scenarios like cascading deletes. Understanding deletion is crucial for managing database integrity and data cleanup.","stage":2},{"uid":3,"title":"SQL Update Course","description":"This course focuses on SQL UPDATE statement, which is used to modify existing records in a database table. You will learn about the syntax of UPDATE statements, setting new values for specific columns, using WHERE clause to update specific records, and handling scenarios such as updating multiple columns and using subqueries.","explanation":"SQL Update Course concentrates on the SQL UPDATE statement for modifying existing records in a database table. For example, you might update a customer\'s address in an \'Customers\' table after they have moved. You\'ll master the syntax of UPDATE statements, setting new values for specific columns, and using WHERE clause for targeted updates. Updating data accurately is crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency.","stage":3},{"uid":1,"title":"SQL Selector Course","description":"This course covers the fundamental SQL SELECT statement, teaching you how to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. You will learn about the syntax of SELECT statements, filtering data with WHERE clause, sorting results with ORDER BY, joining tables with INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and more.","explanation":"SQL Selector Course covers the essential SQL SELECT statement for retrieving data from a database. For instance, you might retrieve a list of products from a \'Products\' table, filtering only those in stock using the WHERE clause and sorting them by price using ORDER BY. You\'ll learn the syntax of SELECT statements, filtering data with WHERE clause, sorting results with ORDER BY, and joining tables with various types of JOINs. Mastering SELECT queries is fundamental for extracting meaningful information from databases.","stage":4}]}');
